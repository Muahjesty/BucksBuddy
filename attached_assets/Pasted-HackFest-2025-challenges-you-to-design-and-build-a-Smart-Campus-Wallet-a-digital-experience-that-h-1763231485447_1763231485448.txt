HackFest 2025 challenges you to design and build a Smart Campus Wallet – a digital experience that helps students manage campus payments, budgets, and daily life in one place.

Your Smart Campus Wallet might help students:

See and understand their spending on and around campus
Track and manage meal plans, dining dollars, and campus card balances
Pay for events, clubs, and campus services from a single interface
Earn rewards or incentives for positive habits
Connect financial decisions to campus life (events, resources, wellbeing)
You are encouraged, but not required, to use the sample data provided in the data/ folder.

AI integration is optional, but encouraged when it clearly improves the experience (for example, by summarizing spending, recommending actions, or answering student questions).

What You Can Build

Your Smart Campus Wallet can focus on one or more of these areas:

Spending dashboard and insights

Show students how they spend across categories like dining, books, transportation, and entertainment. Use charts, summaries, or simple tables so they can quickly understand their habits.

Budgeting and goals

Help students set basic budgets and see when they are close to or over their targets. This could be simple (a weekly dining limit) or more advanced (separate budgets for categories).

Campus payments hub

Create a central place to simulate paying for events, clubs, dining, printing, or other services. You do not need real payment integrations – mock flows and sample data are enough.

Rewards and incentives

Design a simple rewards layer that gives points, streaks, or perks for certain spending or attendance patterns (for example, attending academic events, staying under a dining budget).

Student identity and access (lightweight)

Simulate how a campus wallet might tie together student identity, event check-ins, or gym visits. For example, a “My Activity” view that combines events attended and spending.

Optional AI features

Use AI to summarize spending, suggest smarter decisions, recommend events, or answer questions about balances, budgets, or campus opportunities.

A focused, well-executed idea is better than a broad but incomplete one.

AI Integration (Optional)

AI is not required to participate, but it can be a strong differentiator when used thoughtfully.

Examples of useful AI integrations:

“Explain my spending this week in a few bullet points.”
“Recommend three ways I can save money next month based on my history.”
“What events or resources on campus might help me based on my interests and spending?”
“Summarize my last 30 days in one paragraph I can send to a mentor or advisor.”
You may call AI APIs such as OpenAI, Cohere, or Hugging Face if you wish.
Teams should bring and manage their own API keys and keep them out of public repositories (for example, by using environment variables).

Sample Data (Optional)

The data/ folder contains sample CSV files that teams can use if they want to work with realistic data:

users_sample.csv
Synthetic student profiles: user identifiers, majors, class years, residence type, and interests.

wallet_transactions_sample.csv
Synthetic transaction history for those users: merchant, category, amount, payment method, location, and date.

campus_events_sample.csv
Sample campus events: event names, categories, locations, start times, tags, and costs.

These files are optional. You may ignore them, extend them, or replace them with your own data as long as your project remains aligned with the Smart Campus Wallet theme.
